# MEPS-Data-Project
May 2019, Capstone for Foundations of Data Analytics, CSU Global

This project accesses the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Data, publicly available at: https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/download_data_files.jsp.

Using the Prescribed Medicine files for the years 2006-2016, the goal of the project was to understand the influence of the number of prescriptions versus cost of prescriptions on the rising overall expenditure for Rx Drugs and the whether this trend is individual to different classes of drugs.

The output for this project was generated using SAS Studio software, Version 3.8 of the SAS University Edition for Linux. Copyright Â© 2012-2018 SAS Institute Inc.
